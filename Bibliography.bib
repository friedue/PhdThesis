	The mammalian upstream of N-ras (UNR) protein has been implicated
	in the regulation of mRNA stability and internal ribosome entry site
	(IRES)-dependent mRNA translation. Here we have identified the Drosophila
	homolog of mammalian UNR as a cofactor required for SXL-mediated
	repression of msl-2 translation. UNR interacts with SXL, a female-specific
	protein. Although UNR is present in both male and female flies, binding
	of SXL to uridine-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
	of msl-2 mRNA recruits UNR to adjacent regulatory sequences, thereby
	conferring a sex-specific function to UNR. These data identify a
	novel regulator of dosage compensation in Drosophila that acts coordinately
	with SXL in translational control.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila MSL complex mediates dosage compensation by increasing
	transcription of the single X chromosome in males approximately two-fold.
	This is accomplished through recognition of the X chromosome and
	subsequent acetylation of histone H4K16 on X-linked genes. Initial
	binding to the X is thought to occur at "entry sites" that contain
	a consensus sequence motif ("MSL recognition element" or MRE). However,
	this motif is only âˆ¼2 fold enriched on X, and only a fraction of
	the motifs on X are initially targeted. Here we ask whether chromatin
	context could distinguish between utilized and non-utilized copies
	of the motif, by comparing their relative enrichment for histone
	modifications and chromosomal proteins mapped in the modENCODE project.
	Through a comparative analysis of the chromatin features in male
	S2 cells (which contain MSL complex) and female Kc cells (which lack
	the complex), we find that the presence of active chromatin modifications,
	together with an elevated local GC content in the surrounding sequences,
	has strong predictive value for functional MSL entry sites, independent
	of MSL binding. We tested these sites for function in Kc cells by
	RNAi knockdown of Sxl, resulting in induction of MSL complex. We
	show that ectopic MSL expression in Kc cells leads to H4K16 acetylation
	around these sites and a relative increase in X chromosome transcription.
	Collectively, our results support a model in which a pre-existing
	active chromatin environment, coincident with H3K36me3, contributes
	to MSL entry site selection. The consequences of MSL targeting of
	the male X chromosome include increase in nucleosome lability, enrichment
	for H4K16 acetylation and JIL-1 kinase, and depletion of linker histone
	H1 on active X-linked genes. Our analysis can serve as a model for
	identifying chromatin and local sequence features that may contribute
	to selection of functional protein binding sites in the genome.},

	One hypothesis for this differential reprogramming capacity is the
	"chromatin loosening/enhanced reprogramming" concept, as previously
	described by John Gurdon and Ian Wilmut, as well as others, which
	postulates that the oocyte possesses factors that loosen the somatic

	regulatory factors more ready access to repressed genes and thereby
	significantly increasing epigenetic reprogramming. However, to empirically
	test this hypothesis a list of candidate oocyte reprogramming factors
	(CORFs) must be ascertained that are significantly expressed in metaphase
	II oocytes. Previous studies have focused on intraspecies or cross-species
	transcriptional analysis of up to two different species of oocytes.
	In this study, we have identified eight CORFs (ARID2, ASF1A, ASF1B,
	DPPA3, ING3, MSL3, H1FOO, and KDM6B) based on unbiased global transcriptional

	previously identified reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and
	cMYC) and potentially facilitate the removal of epigenetic memory
	in iPSCs and/or reduce the expression of immunogenicity genes in

	molecular-biological level has been advanced by the ability to determine
	at high resolution the repertoire of mRNA molecules by whole transcriptome
	resequencing. This includes the ability to detect and quantify rare
	abundance transcripts and isoform-specific mRNA variants produced
	from a gene.The sex hierarchy consists of a pre-mRNA splicing cascade
	that directs the production of sex-specific transcription factors
	that specify nearly all sexual dimorphism. We have used deep RNA
	sequencing to gain insight into how the Drosophila sex hierarchy
	generates somatic sex differences, by examining gene and transcript
	isoform expression differences between the sexes in adult head tissues.
	RESULTS: Here we find 1,381 genes that differ in overall expression
	levels and 1,370 isoform-specific transcripts that differ between
	males and females. Additionally, we find 512 genes not regulated
	downstream of transformer that are significantly more highly expressed
	in males than females. These 512 genes are enriched on the Ã— chromosome
	and reside adjacent to dosage compensation complex entry sites, which
	taken together suggests that their residence on the Ã— chromosome
	might be sufficient to confer male-biased expression. There are no
	transcription unit structural features, from a set of features, that
	are robustly significantly different in the genes with significant
	sex differences in the ratio of isoform-specific transcripts, as
	compared to random isoform-specific transcripts, suggesting that
	there is no single molecular mechanism that generates isoform-specific
	transcript differences between the sexes, even though the sex hierarchy
	is known to include three pre-mRNA splicing factors. CONCLUSIONS:
	We identify thousands of genes that show sex-specific differences
	in overall gene expression levels, and identify hundreds of additional
	genes that have differences in the abundance of isoform-specific
	transcripts. No transcription unit structural feature was robustly
	enriched in the sex-differentially expressed transcript isoforms.
	Additionally, we found that many genes with male-biased expression
	were enriched on the Ã— chromosome and reside adjacent to dosage
	compensation entry sites, suggesting that differences in sex chromosome
	composition contributes to dimorphism in gene expression. Taken together,
	this study provides new insight into the molecular underpinnings
	of sexual differentiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The histone acetyltransferase MOF is a member
	of the MYST family. In mammals, MOF plays critical roles by acetylating
	histone H4 at K16 and non-histone substrates such as p53. Here we
	have investigated the role of MOF in human lung cancer and possible
	new substrates of hMOF.
	
	EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Samples of human non-small cell lung cancer
	(NSCLC) were used to correlate MOF with clinicopathological parameters
	and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream genes. 293T-cells were
	used to study interactions between MOF and Nrf2, and acetylation
	of Nrf2 by MOF. Mouse embryonic fibroblast and A549 cells were utilized
	to assess involvement of MOF in antioxidative and anti-drug responses.
	A549 cells were used to analysis the role of MOF in anti-drug response
	in vitro and in vivo.
	
	KEY RESULTS: hMOF was overexpressed in human NSCLC tissues and was
	associated with large tumour size, advanced disease stage and metastasis,
	and with poor prognosis. hMOF levels were positively correlated with
	Nrf2-downstream genes. MOF/hMOF physically interacted with and acetylated
	Nrf2 at Lys(588) . MOF-mediated acetylation increased nuclear retention
	of Nrf2 and transcription of its downstream genes. Importantly, MOF/hMOF
	was essential for anti-oxidative and anti-drug responses in vitro
	and regulated tumour growth and drug resistance in vivo in an Nrf2-dependent
	manner.
	
	CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: hMOF was overexpressed in human NSCLC
	and was a predictor of poor survival. hMOF-mediated Nrf2 acetylation
	and nuclear retention are essential for anti-oxidative and anti-drug
	responses. hMOF may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment
	of NSCLC.},

	resulting in systematically higher rates of transcript production
	at genes with higher Pol II density. Pol II dynamics following short
	inductions indicate that E2 stimulates gene expression by increasing
	Pol II initiation, whereas TNF-α reduces Pol II residence time at

	For its association with Xi, Cdyl requires the process of differentiation

	enriched following Xist RNA coating. We further show that the removal

	The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome,
	thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments
	and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols
	have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription
	factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification
	sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET
	technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends
	of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion
	transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions
	between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis.
	Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading
	cause of end-stage liver disease. Interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN$\alpha$)
	is an important component of anti-HCV therapy; it up-regulates transcription
	of IFN-stimulated genes, many of which have been investigated for
	their antiviral effects. However, all of the genes required for the
	antiviral function of IFN$\alpha$ (IFN effector genes [IEGs]) are
	not known. IEGs include not only IFN-stimulated genes, but other
	nontranscriptionally induced genes that are required for the antiviral
	effect of IFN$\alpha$. In contrast to candidate approaches based
	on analyses of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, identification of
	IEGs requires a broad functional approach.
	
	METHODS: We performed an unbiased genome-wide small interfering RNA
	screen to identify IEGs that inhibit HCV. Huh7.5.1 hepatoma cells
	were transfected with small interfering RNAs incubated with IFN$\alpha$
	and then infected with JFH1 HCV. Cells were stained using HCV core
	antibody, imaged, and analyzed to determine the percent infection.
	Candidate IEGs detected in the screen were validated and analyzed
	further.
	
	RESULTS: The screen identified 120 previously unreported IEGs. From
	these, we more fully evaluated the following: asparagine-linked glycosylation
	10 homolog (yeast, $\alpha$-1,2-glucosyltransferase); butyrylcholinesterase;
	dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (CD26, adenosine deaminase complexing protein
	2); glucokinase (hexokinase 4) regulator; guanylate cyclase 1, soluble,
	$\beta$ 3; MYST histone acetyltransferase 1; protein phosphatase
	3 (formerly 2B), catalytic subunit, $\beta$ isoform; peroxisomal
	proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$-DBD-interacting protein
	1; and solute carrier family 27 (fatty acid transporter), member
	2; and demonstrated that they enabled IFN$\alpha$-mediated suppression
	of HCV at multiple steps of its life cycle. Expression of these genes
	had more potent effects against flaviviridae because a subset was
	required for IFN$\alpha$ to suppress dengue virus but not influenza
	A virus. In addition, many of the host genes detected in this screen
	(92\%) were not transcriptionally stimulated by IFN$\alpha$; these
	genes represent a heretofore unknown class of non-IFN-stimulated
	gene IEGs.
	
	CONCLUSIONS: We performed a whole-genome loss-of-function screen to
	identify genes that mediate the effects of IFN$\alpha$ against human
	pathogenic viruses. We found that IFN$\alpha$ restricts HCV via actions
	of general and specific IEGs.},

	that new sex chromosomes are derived from autosomes, we also calculate
	the cost of unmasking deleterious mutations segregating on the nascent
	sex chromosomes as loci become hemizygous. The importance of deleterious
	mutations to the fitness cost of hemizygosity depends on their frequency,
	and on the relative costs of halving gene dose for wild-type alleles.
	We then consider the evolution of DC in response to gene loss, and
	include a cost of overexpression (i.e., DC such that expression exceeds
	the wild-type homozygote). Even with costs to excess flux, hypomorphic
	mutations can cause the optimal level of DC to be higher than 2-fold
	when the absolute cost of hemizygosity is small. Finally, we propose
	a three-step model of DC evolution: 1) once recombination ceases
	and the Y begins to deteriorate, genes from longer metabolic pathways
	should be lost first, as halving these genes does not drastically
	reduce flux or, thereby, fitness; 2) both the cost of hemizygosity
	and the presence of hypomorphic mutations will drive an increase
	in expression, that is, DC; 3) existing DC will now permit loss of
	genes in short pathways.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histone post-translational modifications are critical
	determinants of chromatin structure and function, impacting multiple
	biological processes including DNA transcription, replication, and
	repair. The post-translational acetylation of histone H4 at lysine
	16 (H4K16ac) was initially identified in association with dosage
	compensation of the Drosophila male X chromosome. However, in mammalian
	cells, H4K16ac is not associated with dosage compensation and the
	genomic distribution of H4K16ac is not precisely known. Therefore,
	we have mapped the genome-wide H4K16ac distribution in human cells.
	
	RESULTS: We performed H4K16ac chromatin immunoprecipitation from human
	embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells followed by hybridization to
	whole-genome tiling arrays and identified 25,893 DNA regions (false
	discovery rate <0.005) with average length of 692 nucleotides. Interestingly,
	although a majority of H4K16ac sites localized within genes, only
	a relatively small fraction (\~{}10\%) was found near promoters,
	in contrast to the distribution of the acetyltransferase, MOF, responsible
	for acetylation at K16 of H4. Using differential gene expression
	profiling data, 73 genes (> ±1.5-fold) were identified as potential
	H4K16ac-regulated genes. Seventeen transcription factor-binding sites
	were significantly associated with H4K16ac occupancy. In addition,
	a consensus 12-nucleotide guanine-rich sequence motif was identified
	in more than 55\% of the H4K16ac peaks.
	
	CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that H4K16 acetylation has a limited
	effect on transcription regulation in HEK293 cells, whereas H4K16ac
	has been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating transcription
	in mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, H4K16ac-dependent transcription
	regulation is likely a cell type specific process.},

  abstract = {58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) plays an important role in a
	variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation,
	cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Currently, the mechanisms
	underlying the oncogenic effect of MSP58 are not fully understood.
	The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which encodes
	an essential component for telomerase activity that is involved in
	cellular immortalization and transformation, is strictly regulated
	at the gene transcription level. Our previous study revealed a novel
	function of MSP58 in cellular senescence. Here we identify telomerase
	transcriptional element-interacting factor (TEIF) as a novel MSP58-interacting
	protein and determine the effect of MSP58 on hTERT transcription.
	This study thus provides evidence showing MSP58 to be a negative
	regulator of hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Luciferase
	reporter assays indicated that MSP58 could suppress the transcription
	ofhTERTpromoter. Additionally, stable overexpression of MSP58 protein
	in HT1080 and 293T cells decreased both endogenous hTERT expression
	and telomerase activity. Conversely, their upregulation was induced
	by MSP58 silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that
	MSP58 binds to the hTERT proximal promoter. Furthermore, overexpression
	of MSP58 inhibited TEIF-mediated hTERT transactivation, telomerase
	activation, and cell proliferation promotion. The inhibitory effect
	of MSP58 occurred through inhibition of TEIF binding to DNA. Ultimately,
	the HT1080-implanted xenograft mouse model confirmed these cellular
	effects. Together, our findings provide new insights into both the
	biological function of MSP58 and the regulation of telomerase/hTERT
	expression.},

	oncogene implicated in modulating cellular proliferation and malignant
	transformation. In this study, we show that knocking down MSP58 expression
	caused aneuploidy and led to apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression
	of MSP58 regulated cell proliferation in a context-dependent manner.
	Specifically, ectopic expression of MSP58 in normal human IMR90 and
	Hs68 diploid fibroblasts, the H184B5F5/M10 mammary epithelial cell
	line, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts,
	and immortalized NIH3T3 fibroblasts resulted in induction of premature
	senescence, an enlarged and flattened cellular morphology, and increased
	senescence-associated $\beta$-galactosidase activity. MSP58-driven
	senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53
	as revealed by the fact that normal cells with p53 knockdown by specific
	shRNA or cells with a mutated or functionally impaired p53 pathway
	were effective in bypassing MSP58-induced senescence. At least two
	senescence mechanisms are induced by MSP58. First, MSP58 activates
	the DNA damage response and p53/p21 signaling pathways. Second, MSP58,
	p53, and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling subunit Brahma-related
	gene 1 (BRG1) form a ternary complex on the p21 promoter and collaborate
	to activate p21. Additionally, MSP58 protein levels increased in
	cells undergoing replicative senescence and stress-induced senescence.
	Notably, the results of analyzing expression levels of MSP58 between
	tumors and matched normal tissues showed significant changes (both
	up- and down-regulation) in its expression in various types of tumors.
	Our findings highlight new aspects of MSP58 in modulating cellular
	senescence and suggest that MSP58 has both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive
	properties.},

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase II core promoter is sometimes referred to as the
	gateway to transcription. The core promoter is generally defined
	to be the stretch of DNA that directs the initiation of transcription.
	This simple description belies a complex multidimensional regulatory
	element, as there is considerable diversity in core promoter structure
	and function. Core promoters can be viewed at the levels of DNA sequences,
	transcription factors, and biological networks. Key DNA sequences
	are known as core promoter elements, which include the TATA box,
	initiator (Inr), polypyrimidine initiator (TCT), TFIIB recognition
	element (BRE), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream core promoter
	element (DPE) motifs. There are no universal core promoter elements
	that are present in all promoters. Different types of core promoters
	are transcribed by different sets of transcription factors and exhibit
	distinct properties, such as specific interactions with transcriptional
	enhancers, that are determined by the presence or absence of particular
	core promoter motifs. Moreover, some core promoter elements have
	been found to be associated with specific biological networks. For
	instance, the TCT motif is dedicated to the transcription of ribosomal
	protein genes in Drosophila and humans. In addition, nearly all of
	the Drosophila Hox genes have a DPE motif in their core promoters.
	The complexity of the core promoter is further seen in the relation
	among transcription initiation patterns, the stability or lability
	of transcriptional states, and the organization of the chromatin
	structure in the promoter region. Hence, the current data indicate
	that the core promoter is a critical component in the regulation
	of gene activity.},

  abstract = {Higher order folding of chromatin fibre is mediated by interactions
	of the histone H4 N-terminal tail domains with neighbouring nucleosomes.
	Mechanistically, the H4 tails of one nucleosome bind to the acidic
	patch region on the surface of adjacent nucleosomes, causing fibre
	compaction. The functionality of the chromatin fibre can be modified
	by proteins that interact with the nucleosome. The co-structures
	of five different proteins with the nucleosome (LANA, IL-33, RCC1,
	Sir3 and HMGN2) recently have been examined by experimental and computational
	studies. Interestingly, each of these proteins displays steric, ionic
	and hydrogen bond complementarity with the acidic patch, and therefore
	will compete with each other for binding to the nucleosome. We first
	review the molecular details of each interface, focusing on the key
	non-covalent interactions that stabilize the protein-acidic patch
	interactions. We then propose a model in which binding of proteins
	to the nucleosome disrupts interaction of the H4 tail domains with
	the acidic patch, preventing the intrinsic chromatin folding pathway
	and leading to assembly of alternative higher order chromatin structures
	with unique biological functions.},

  abstract = {Many human genes exhibit evidence of initiated RNA polymerase II
	(Pol II) at their promoters, despite a lack of significant full-length
	transcript. Such genes exhibit promoter-proximal "pausing," wherein
	initiated Pol II accumulates just downstream of the transcription
	start site due to a rate-limiting step mediating the transition to
	elongation. The mechanisms that regulate the escape of Pol II from
	pausing and the relationship to chromatin structure remain incompletely
	understood. Recently, we showed that CpG island hypermethylation
	and epigenetic silencing of TMS1/ASC in human breast cancers are
	accompanied by a local shift from histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation
	(H4K16Ac) to H4 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Here, we show
	that hMOF-mediated H4K16Ac and SUV420H2-mediated H4K20me3 play opposing
	roles in the regulation of Pol II pausing. We found that H4K16Ac
	promoted the release of Pol II from pausing through the recruitment
	of BRD4 and pTEFb. Aberrant methylation of CpG island DNA blocked
	Pol II recruitment to gene promoters. Whereas the inhibition of DNA
	methylation allowed for the reassociation and initiation of Pol II
	at the TMS1 promoter, Pol II remained paused in the presence of H4K20me3.
	Combined inhibition of H4K20me3 and DNA methylation resulted in the
	rerecruitment of hMOF and subsequent H4K16Ac, release of Pol II into
	active elongation, and synergistic reactivation of TMS1 expression.
	Marking by H4K20me3 was not restricted to TMS1 but also occurred
	at other genes independently of DNA methylation, where it similarly
	imposed a block to Pol II promoter escape through a mechanism that
	involved the local inhibition of H4K16Ac. These data indicate that
	H4K20me3 invokes gene repression by antagonizing hMOF-mediated H4K16Ac
	and suggest that overcoming Pol II pausing might be a rate-limiting
	step in achieving tumor suppressor gene reactivation in cancer therapy.},

	phosphorylation (H3T11P) promotes AR target gene activation. However,
	the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we show
	that WDR5, a subunit of the SET1/MLL complex, interacts with H3T11P,
	and this interaction facilitates the recruitment of the MLL1 complex
	and subsequent H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3). Using ChIP-seq, we
	find that androgen stimulation results in a 6-fold increase in the
	number of H3T11P-marked regions and induces WDR5 colocalization to
	one third of H3T11P-enriched promoters, thus establishing a genome-wide
	relationship between H3T11P and recruitment of WDR5. Accordingly,
	PKN1 knockdown or chemical inhibition severely blocks WDR5 chromatin
	association and H3K4me3 on AR target genes. Finally, WDR5 is critical
	in prostate cancer cell proliferation and is hyperexpressed in human
	prostate cancers. Together, these results identify WDR5 as a critical
	epigenomic integrator of histone phosphorylation and methylation
	and as a major driver of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell

  abstract = {MOF is the major histone H4 lysine 16-specific (H4K16) acetyltransferase
	in mammals and Drosophila. In flies, it is involved in the regulation
	of X-chromosomal and autosomal genes as part of the MSL and the NSL
	complexes, respectively. While the function of the MSL complex as
	a dosage compensation regulator is fairly well understood, the role
	of the NSL complex in gene regulation is still poorly characterized.
	Here we report a comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex
	members (NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2) throughout the Drosophila
	melanogaster genome. Strikingly, the majority (85.5\%) of NSL-bound
	genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. We
	find that an increased abundance of the histone modifications H4K16ac,
	H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions is characteristic
	of NSL-targeted genes. Furthermore, we show that these genes have
	a well-defined nucleosome free region and broad transcription initiation
	patterns. Finally, by performing ChIP-seq analyses of RNA polymerase
	II (Pol II) in NSL1- and NSL3-depleted cells, we demonstrate that
	both NSL proteins are required for efficient recruitment of Pol II
	to NSL target gene promoters. The observed Pol II reduction coincides
	with compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters, indicating
	that the NSL complex is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation
	complex on target genes. Moreover, genes that undergo the most dramatic
	loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication-related
	Element (DRE). Taken together, our findings show that the MOF-containing
	NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies
	by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription.},

	The biochemical mechanisms used for dosage compensation must function

	three X-linked sites. At all sites, the arm-lacZ reporter gene was

	genes explain only 10-40\% of the differences in protein levels.
	We find, however, that these surveys have significantly underestimated
	protein abundances and the relative importance of transcription.
	Using individual measurements for 61 housekeeping proteins to rescale
	whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al. (2011), we find that
	the median protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per
	cell and that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher
	correlation with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein
	data. In addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA
	and protein abundances using direct experimental measurements of
	these errors. The resulting analysis suggests that mRNA levels explain
	at least 56\% of the differences in protein abundance for the 4,212
	genes detected by Schwanhausser et al. (2011), though because one
	major source of error could not be estimated the true percent contribution
	should be higher. We also employed a second, independent strategy

	We show that the variance in translation rates directly measured
	by ribosome profiling is only 12\% of that inferred by Schwanhausser
	et al. (2011), and that the measured and inferred translation rates
	correlate poorly (R(2) = 0.13). Based on this, our second strategy
	suggests that mRNA levels explain ∼81\% of the variance in protein
	levels. We also determined the percent contributions of transcription,
	RNA degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance
	in protein abundances using both of our strategies. While the magnitudes
	of the two estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays
	a more important role than the earlier studies implied and translation
	a much smaller role. Finally, the above estimates only apply to those
	genes whose mRNA and protein expression was detected. Based on a
	detailed analysis by Hebenstreit et al. (2012), we estimate that
	approximately 40\% of genes in a given cell within a population express
	no mRNA. Since there can be no translation in the absence of mRNA,
	we argue that differences in translation rates can play no role in
	determining the expression levels for the ∼40\% of genes that are

  abstract = {Most genes along the male single X chromosome in Drosophila are hypertranscribed
	about two-fold relative to each of the two female X chromosomes.
	This is accomplished by the MSL (male-specific lethal) complex that
	acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16. The MSL complex contains two
	large noncoding RNAs, roX1 (RNA on X) and roX2, that help target
	chromatin modifying enzymes to the X. The roX RNAs are functionally
	redundant but differ in size, sequence, and transcriptional control.
	We wanted to find out how roX1 production is regulated. Ectopic DC
	can be induced in wild-type (roX1(+) roX2(+)) females if we provide
	a heterologous source of MSL2. However, in the absence of roX2, we
	found that roX1 expression failed to come on reliably. Using an in
	situ hybridization probe that is specific only to endogenous roX1,
	we found that expression was restored if we introduced either roX2
	or a truncated but functional version of roX1. This shows that pre-existing
	roX RNA is required to positively autoregulate roX1 expression. We
	also observed massive cis spreading of the MSL complex from the site
	of roX1 transcription at its endogenous location on the X chromosome.
	We propose that retention of newly assembled MSL complex around the
	roX gene is needed to drive sustained transcription and that spreading
	into flanking chromatin contributes to the X chromosome targeting
	specificity. Finally, we found that the gene encoding the key male-limited
	protein subunit, msl2, is transcribed predominantly during DNA replication.
	This suggests that new MSL complex is made as the chromatin template
	doubles. We offer a model describing how the production of roX1 and
	msl2, two key components of the MSL complex, are coordinated to meet
	the dosage compensation demands of the male cell.},

	1 by sequestering Daxx to the nuclear bodies and the cytoplasm, respectively.
	Here, we further investigated the coordinated molecular mechanism

	Using yeast two-hybrid screens to identify Daxx-interacting protein(s),

	signal-regulating kinase 1, and promyelocytic leukemia protein, suggesting
	a unique modulatory role of MSP58 on Daxx function. Transient transfection

	Daxx in a dose-dependent manner in COS-1 and 293 cells but not in

	It is therefore necessary to identify some new certain tumor biomarkers

	However, whether MSP58 can be used as a biomarker to evaluate the

	present study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate
	MSP58 protein expression in 158 specimens of human gliomas and 34

	MSP58 expression was not only significantly higher in the glioma
	tissues (P < 0.05), but also increased with the increasing pathological

	of the genome into early and late replication domains is important
	for maintaining genome stability, gene dosage, and epigenetic inheritance;
	however, the molecular mechanisms that define and establish these
	domains are poorly understood. The modENCODE Project provided an
	opportunity to investigate the chromatin features that define the
	Drosophila replication timing program in multiple cell lines. The
	majority of early and late replicating domains in the Drosophila
	genome were static across all cell lines; however, a small subset

	between the cell lines. Both origin selection and activation contribute
	to defining the DNA replication program. Our results suggest that
	static early and late replicating domains were defined at the level
	of origin selection (ORC binding) and likely mediated by chromatin
	accessibility. In contrast, dynamic domains exhibited low ORC densities

	selection governs the plasticity of the DNA replication program.
	Finally, we show that the male-specific early replication of the

	This complex region has a distinct type of chromatin in which histone
	H3 is replaced by a structurally different homologue identified in
	humans as CENP-A. In metazoans, specific DNA sequences are neither
	required nor sufficient for centromere identity. Rather, an epigenetic
	mark comprised of CENP-A containing chromatin is thought to be the
	major determinant of centromere identity. In this view, CENP-A deposition
	and chromatin assembly are fundamental processes for the maintenance
	of centromeric identity across mitotic and meiotic divisions. Several
	lines of evidence support CENP-A deposition in metazoans occurring
	at only one time in the cell cycle. Such cell cycle-dependent loading
	of CENP-A is found in divergent species from human to fission yeast,
	albeit with differences in the cell cycle point at which CENP-A is
	assembled. Cell cycle dependent CENP-A deposition requires multiple

  abstract = {In this monograph, Ohno, who has contributed much to this field,
	makes a number of general statements about sex chromosomes which
	he supports by references to many pieces of cytological and genetic
	research made in the last ten years. The book deals only with the
	sex chromosomes of vertebrates although, for comparative purposes,
	frequent reference is made to the cytogenetic situation of Drosophila.
	The book is not about cytological technique. There are excellent
	photographs of the chromosomes of representative species of fish,
	birds, reptiles and mammals; with 33 illustrations the book is adequately
	but not lavishly illustrated. The author seems less concerned with
	presenting a balanced discussion than with achieving a clear presentation
	of ideas. In summary, from a broad review of the nuclear DNA content
	and sex-determining mechanism in various vertebrates, Ohno reconstructs
	the process of sex-chromosome differentiation. It is suggested that
	the crossopterygian fishes, from which terrestrial vertebrates evolved
	in ancient times, represented diverse genome linkages in varying
	degrees of polyploidisation. The subsequent emergence of the sex-determining
	mechanism stabilised each genome lineage. Placental mammals with
	male hetero-gamety belong to one genome lineage and avian species
	with female heterogamety to another. Whereas speciation in eutherian
	mammals has been accomplished by allelic mutations coupled with a
	constant reshuffling of the autosomal linkage groups, the original
	X-chromosome of a common ancestor seems to have been preserved with
	a high degree of stability. This stability may exist because most
	X-to-autosome translocations would disrupt the dosage compensation
	mechanism which, in mammals, is achieved by random inactivation of
	one or other of the X-chromosomes in individual female somatic cells.
	In avian species there is no dosage-compensation for Z-linked genes.
	In mammals the sex-determining factors express themselves in embryonic
	somatic cells which produce hormones so that a testis or ovary results
	from indifferent gonads. There are subject and author indexes, and
	reference lists are at the end of each chapter. G. G. Selman.},

	inhibition of cellular transformation requires physical interaction
	as evidenced by the failure of PTEN(T366A) point mutation (residing
	within the MSP58 interaction domain) to suppress MSP-58-driven transformation.
	These observations, together with the capacity of catalytically inactive
	PTEN mutant (G129R) to suppress MSP58 oncogenicity, support the view

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously identified a panel of genes associated
	with outcome of ovarian cancer. The purpose of the current study
	was to assess whether variants in these genes correlated with ovarian
	cancer risk.
	
	METHODS AND FINDINGS: Women with and without invasive ovarian cancer
	(749 cases, 1,041 controls) were genotyped at 136 single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) within 13 candidate genes. Risk was estimated
	for each SNP and for overall variation within each gene. At the gene-level,
	variation within MSL1 (male-specific lethal-1 homolog) was associated
	with risk of serous cancer (p = 0.03); haplotypes within PRPF31 (PRP31
	pre-mRNA processing factor 31 homolog) were associated with risk
	of invasive disease (p = 0.03). MSL1 rs7211770 was associated with
	decreased risk of serous disease (OR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.66-0.98; p =
	0.03). SNPs in MFSD7, BTN3A3, ZNF200, PTPRS, and CCND1A were inversely
	associated with risk (p<0.05), and there was increased risk at HEXIM1
	rs1053578 (p = 0.04, OR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.02-1.91).
	
	CONCLUSIONS: Tumor studies can reveal novel genes worthy of follow-up
	for cancer susceptibility. Here, we found that inherited markers
	in the gene encoding MSL1, part of a complex that modifies the histone
	H4, may decrease risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer.},

	not only between the two sexes, but also between X and the autosomes.
	In Drosophila melanogaster, the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex
	is believed to produce a 2-fold increase in expression of genes on
	the male X, thus restoring this balance.RESULTS:Here we show that
	almost all the genes on the male X are effectively compensated. However,
	many genes are compensated without any significant recruitment of
	the MSL-complex. These genes are very weakly, if at all, affected
	by mutations or RNAi against MSL-complex components. In addition,
	even the genes that are strongly bound by MSL rely on mechanisms
	other than the MSL-complex for proper compensation. We find that
	long, non-ubiquitously expressed genes tend to rely less on the MSL-complex
	for their compensation and genes that in addition are far from High
	Affinity Sites tend to not bind the complex at all or very weakly.CONCLUSIONS:We
	conclude that most of the compensation of X-linked genes is produced
	by an MSL-independent mechanism. Similar to the case of the MSL-mediated
	compensation we do not yet know the mechanism behind the MSL-independent
	compensation that appears to act preferentially on long genes. Even
	if we observe similarities, it remains to be seen if the mechanism
	is related to the buffering that is observed in autosomal aneuploidies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Drosophila embryos, checkpoints maintain genome stability
	by delaying cell cycle progression that allows time for damage repair
	or to complete DNA synthesis. Drosophila MOF, a member of MYST histone
	acetyl transferase is an essential component of male X hyperactivation
	process. Until recently its involvement in G2/M cell cycle arrest
	and defects in ionizing radiation induced DNA damage pathways was
	not well established.
	
	RESULTS: Drosophila MOF is highly expressed during early embryogenesis.
	In the present study we show that haplo-insufficiency of maternal
	MOF leads to spontaneous mitotic defects like mitotic asynchrony,
	mitotic catastrophe and chromatid bridges in the syncytial embryos.
	Such abnormal nuclei are eliminated and digested in the yolk tissues
	by nuclear fall out mechanism. MOF negatively regulates Drosophila
	checkpoint kinase 2 tumor suppressor homologue. In response to DNA
	damage the checkpoint gene Chk2 (Drosophila mnk) is activated in
	the mof mutants, there by causing centrosomal inactivation suggesting
	its role in response to genotoxic stress. A drastic decrease in the
	fall out nuclei in the syncytial embryos derived from mof females
	further confirms the role of DNA damage response gene Chk2 to ensure
	the removal of abnormal nuclei from the embryonic precursor pool
	and maintain genome stability. The fact that mof mutants undergo
	DNA damage has been further elucidated by the increased number of
	single and double stranded DNA breaks.
	
	CONCLUSION: mof mutants exhibited genomic instability as evidenced
	by the occurance of frequent mitotic bridges in anaphase, asynchronous
	nuclear divisions, disruption of cytoskeleton, inactivation of centrosomes
	finally leading to DNA damage. Our findings are consistent to what
	has been reported earlier in mammals that; reduced levels of MOF
	resulted in increased genomic instability while total loss resulted
	in lethality. The study can be further extended using Drosophila
	as model system and carry out the interaction of MOF with the known
	components of the DNA damage pathway.},

	to their target promoters independently of MOF. However, depletion

	is interdependent and relies mainly on the presence of NSL1 and MCRS2.
	Tethering of NSL3 to a heterologous promoter leads to robust transcription

	through Eaf5. This trimeric subcomplex represents a functional module,
	and a large portion exists in a native form outside the NuA4 complex.
	Gene-specific and genome-wide location analyses indicate that Eaf5/7/3

	cryptic transcription arising in set2 mutants, supporting a role

	leads to an increase of replication-independent histone exchange

	demonstrate that methylation of the CpG in the ETS, NRF-1, and SP1

	in regulated gene expression while TFBS that contain a CpG are involved
	in constitutive gene expression with some CpG containing sequences
	also involved in inducible and tissue specific gene regulation. These

	by blocking H4K16ac deacetylation. MOF was found to be associated
	with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs),
	a protein involved in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. ATM-dependent

	The acetylation of Lys-120 does not appear to regulate the ability

	However, displacement of the inhibitory MCL-1 protein from BAK is
	compromised when Lys-120 acetylation is blocked. Functional studies

	in human cancer, inhibits transcription-independent apoptosis, and
	enforced acetylation of Lys-120 enhances transcription-independent
	apoptosis. These data support a model whereby Lys-120 acetylation
	contributes to both the transcription-dependent and -independent
	apoptotic pathways induced by p53.},

	deregulation of gene expression. Both properties are essential to
	allow the genome expansion characteristic of complex eukaryotes.
	The nucleosome is a flexible structure in vivo, allowing selective
	relaxation of its intrinsically inhibitory effects in response to
	external signals. Structural changes are brought about by dedicated
	remodelling enzymes and by posttranslational modifications of the
	core histones. Histone modifications occasionally alter nucleosome
	structure directly, but their more usual roles are to act as receptors
	on the nucleosome surface that are recognised by specific protein
	domains. The bound proteins, in turn, affect nucleosome structure
	and function. This strategy enormously expands the signalling capacity
	of the nucleosome and its ability to influence both the initiation
	and elongation stages of transcription. The enzymes responsible for
	placing and removing histone modifications, and the modification-binding
	proteins themselves, are ubiquitous, numerous and conserved amongst
	eukaryotes. Like the nucleosome, they date back to the earliest eukaryotes

	modification. Using a SIR-regulated heat shock-inducible transgene,
	hsp82-2001, and a natural drug-inducible subtelomeric gene, YFR057w,

  abstract = {hMOF (MYST1), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), forms at least two
	distinct multiprotein complexes in human cells. The male specific
	lethal (MSL) HAT complex plays a key role in dosage compensation
	in Drosophila and is responsible for histone H4K16ac in vivo. We
	and others previously described a second hMOF-containing HAT complex,
	the non-specific lethal (NSL) HAT complex. The NSL complex has a
	broader substrate specificity, can acetylate H4 on K16, K5, and K8.
	The WD (tryptophan-aspartate) repeat domain 5 (WDR5) and host cell
	factor 1 (HCF1) are shared among members of the MLL/SET (mixed-lineage
	leukemia/set-domain containing) family of histone H3K4 methyltransferase
	complexes. The presence of these shared subunits raises the possibility
	that there are functional links between these complexes and the histone
	modifications they catalyze; however, the degree to which NSL and
	MLL/SET influence one another's activities remains unclear. Here,
	we present evidence from biochemical assays and knockdown/overexpression
	approaches arguing that the NSL HAT promotes histone H3K4me2 by MLL/SET
	complexes by an acetylation-dependent mechanism. In genomic experiments,
	we identified a set of genes including ANKRD2, that are affected
	by knockdown of both NSL and MLL/SET subunits, suggested they are
	co-regulated by NSL and MLL/SET complexes. In ChIP assays, we observe
	that depletion of the NSL subunits hMOF or NSL1 resulted in a significant
	reduction of both H4K16ac and H3K4me2 in the vicinity of the ANKRD2
	transcriptional start site proximal region. However, depletion of
	RbBP5 (a core component of MLL/SET complexes) only reduced H3K4me2
	marks, but not H4K16ac in the same region of ANKRD2, consistent with
	the idea that NSL acts upstream of MLL/SET to regulate H3K4me2 at
	certain promoters, suggesting coordination between NSL and MLL/SET
	complexes is involved in transcriptional regulation of certain genes.
	Taken together, our results suggest a crosstalk between the NSL and
	MLL/SET complexes in cells.},

  abstract = {The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SirT1 regulates gene silencing and
	genomic stability in response to nutrient deprivation and DNA damage.
	An important regulator of SirT1 in mammalian cells is DBC1 (deleted
	in breast cancer 1; KIAA1967 or CCAR2), which binds to SirT1 and
	inhibits the deacetylation of substrates. Recent studies have revealed
	that ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation of DBC1 promotes binding to
	SirT1. Here we show that DBC1 is modified by acetylation on two N-terminal
	lysine residues (K112 and K215). The MYST family histone acetyltransferase
	hMOF (human MOF) is responsible for DBC1 acetylation. Acetylation
	of K112 and K215 inhibits DBC1-SirT1 binding and increases SirT1
	deacetylase activity. SirT1 also promotes DBC1 deacetylation, suggesting
	the presence of a negative-feedback mechanism that stabilizes the
	SirT1-DBC1 complex and limits SirT1 activity. hMOF binding and acetylation
	of DBC1 are inhibited after DNA damage in an ATM-dependent fashion,
	contributing to increased SirT1-DBC1 binding after DNA damage. Furthermore,
	a DBC1 mutant that mimics the acetylated state fails to promote apoptosis
	after DNA damage. These results suggest that acetylation of DBC1
	inhibits binding to SirT1 and serves as a mechanism that connects
	DNA damage signaling to SirT1 and cell fate determination.},

  abstract = {The SNF2h-containing chromatin-remodeling complex NoRC is responsible
	for silencing a fraction of mammalian rRNA genes (rDNA). NoRC silences
	transcription by establishing heterochromatic features-including
	DNA methylation, hypoacetylation of histone H4, and methylation of
	H3K9-at the rDNA promoter []. We have investigated the mechanism
	of NoRC-mediated rDNA silencing and show that binding of the bromodomain
	of TIP5, the large subunit of NoRC, to acetylated nucleosomes is
	a prerequisite for NoRC function. A point mutation within the bromodomain
	impairs the association of NoRC with chromatin, prevents heterochromatin
	formation, and abolishes transcriptional repression. Moreover, the
	association of NoRC with chromatin requires acetylation of histone
	H4 at lysine 16 (acH4K16), and binding to acH4K16 is required for
	subsequent deacetylation of H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12, indicating that
	acetylation of H4K16 plays an active role in NoRC-mediated heterochromatin
	formation. The bromodomain cooperates with an adjacent PHD finger
	to recruit HDAC1, DNMT1, DNMT3, and SNF2h to rDNA. If specifically
	targeted to the rDNA promoter, the PHD finger/bromodomain is capable
	of establishing heterochromatic features and rDNA silencing. Thus,
	the PHD finger/bromodomain represents an autonomous unit that binds
	to acH4K16 and coordinates the chain of events that establish the
	repressed state of rDNA.},
